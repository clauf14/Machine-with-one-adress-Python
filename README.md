## ❔ What is this project about?
This project attempts to simulate as closely as possible the operation of a logic processor by using the fundamental operation of a processor, such as reading, writing, jumping from a adress to another, etc. The instructions are made after this table:

## 🛠️ How it was built?

🐍 This application was built using **Python**.

🖼️ The design was made using the **Tkinter** library.

🖌️ So this is the design for the interface. We have a Text Box where we can write what operation we need to do from the list below. As you can see, we have 12 different operations.

❕ Let's select the "Factorial" option, that does what the name says.

🤞🏻 Good, now let's press "Calculeaza" button which means "Calculate".

✅ The button turns green, so we need to continue to the local console.

😎 Cool, now we have to enter the value of the number whose result we want to know. I'll choose **5**.

🤩And the the result appears immediately right next to **"Valoarea numarului"** and it is **120**, because **5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5** . Below the result we have the operations and the addresses where these operations were performed to solve the **"Factorial"** option. In **Memory[number]**, number is the adress of the operation.
